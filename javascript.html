<h1>10 Days Of JAVASCRIPT</h1>

<h3><u>Day 1: Arithmetic Operators</u></h3>
<h3>Operator types</h3><hr>
<p><b>Unary</b></p>
<p>A unary operator requires a single operand,either before or after the operator,following this format:<br>
operator operand</p>
<p><b>Binary</b></p>
<p>A binary operator requires two operands ,one before the operator and one after the operator,following this format:<br>
operand1 operator operator2</p>
<p><b>Ternary</b></p>
<p>There is one ternary ,the conditional operator.For example, in the expression a ? b : c, the use of ? and : in this manner constitues the ternary operator. We'll discuss the statements more in the <i>Conditional statements</i> tutorial.</p>
<p><b>Arithmetic Operators</b></p>
<p>An arithmetic operator takes numeric values (either literals or variables) as its operands and returns a single numeric value.The standard arithmetic operators are addition(+), subtraction(-),multiplication(*), and division(/).Other arithmetic operator are remainder(%),unary negation(-),unary plus(+),increment(++),decrement(--), and exponentiation(**).</p>
<h3><u>Day 2: Functions</u></h3><hr>
<p>Functions in javascript are declared using the <i>function</i> keyword.A function declaration creates a function that's a <i>Function</i> object having all the properties,methods and behaviour of function objects.By default,functions return statement that consists of the <i>return</i> keyword followed by the value to be returned(this can be a literal value a variable or even a call to a function.<br>
  Example: function sum(a+b) {<br> &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
    return a+b ;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
}<br>

<b> <u>The Function Expression</u></b>
<p> The function expression is very similar to (and has almost the same syntax as) a function statement.The main difference between a function expression and a function statement is the function name, which can be omitted from the function expression to create an anonymous function.</p>
<p><b>Recursion</b></p>
<p>This is an extremely important algorithmic concept that involves splitting a problem into two parts : a base case  and a recursive case.The problem is divided into smaller subproblems which are then solved
recursively until such time as they are small enough and meet some base case; once the base case is met,the solution for each subproblem is combined and their result is answer to the entire problem.</p>
<p>If the base case is not met, the function's recursive case calls the function again with modified values.the code must be structured in such a way that the base case is reachable after some number of iterations,meaning that each subsequent modified values should bring you closer and closer to the base case:otherwise: you'll be stuck in the
dreaded infinite loop.</p/><br>
